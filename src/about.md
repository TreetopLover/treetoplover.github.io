title: About

I am a stay-at-home father of twin boys and a teenage girl. You can find a little more of my backstory [here](/2021/09/22/hello-world/). This blog is a 
landing page for my thoughts on life as a dad, changing careers in my forties, the process of learning the skills necessary for said 
change, and probably fishing, or sausage, or Brandon Sanderson occasionally.
