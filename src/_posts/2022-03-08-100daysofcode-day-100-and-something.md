*Oops...*   
<br>
Well, that came and went. I'll be honest, I think I did pretty well for a while there. The learning was going well. I finished two FreeCodeCamp certifications, built a few projects, got into React and bought a new laptop. It was the *out loud* part that I struggled with.   
<br>
It turns out that Twitter is not easy for me to keep up with. Neither is this blog. I could make some excuses but I won't. All I'll say is that I'm re-prioritizing my time.   
<br>
Wish me luck.
