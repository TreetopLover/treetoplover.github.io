*I got a job!*   
<br>
First off, long time no see. Mea culpa.   
<br>
I've spent the past couple of years with my nose in the proverbial book, trying to re-learn the basics of front-end web development. Why front end? Not sure. Honestly, I think FreeCodeCamp was the first free learning resource I came across that seemed like something I could retain in the sporadic schedule I had available. Javascript was pretty niche when I was in school and it blew my mind to see the current state of the language. All the pretty frameworks were a bit distracting but I was committed to a path of learning.   
<br>
Several months ago I was muddling through a project, using React to build a virtual drum machine, and I got a text from my kick-ass brother-in-law telling me to stop what I was working on and go check out [](Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails tutorial). I did, and I loved it.   
<br>
Fast forward a bit and I've spent the last eight months working part-time on a smallish Rails app for a healthcare-related non-profit and I'm learning something new every day. Things are still moving at a slower pace than I would like, and my desk chair slowly sinks every fifteen minutes, but I'm in a pretty good place. At the end of the day, I've landed my first web development gig, and I know how lucky I am. Time to start learning on the job.
