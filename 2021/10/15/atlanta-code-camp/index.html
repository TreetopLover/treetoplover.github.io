<h2>Atlanta Code Camp</h2>

<p><em>More people than I expected but safe and exciting.</em><br />
<br />
Saturday 10/9 was the annual Atlanta Code Camp and I made the last-minute decision to take the drive up to ATL and see what it was all about. I’m glad I did.<br />
<br />
I heard about the conference on a recent episode of the Coding Blocks podcast, which helped to sponsor the event and showed up with a booth full of quality swag. Outside of some local food vendor shows and a couple of trips to the  International Pizza Expo in Las Vegas, this is my first time attending anything quite like this. I was a little apprehensive about being around that many people but counted on other folks feeling the same way. Attendance was obviously lower than in the past, but I was surprised to find quite a crowd. Despite that, the organizers did a great job of making everyone feel pretty safe. Everyone was masked and there was plenty of room to spread out.<br />
<br />
As far as the speakers go, I was pretty impressed. I’ll be honest, as a #codenewbie, my interest was fairly limited. Not that I haven’t watched a few YouTube videos on Docker and Kubernetes, but I don’t need that in my head right now. For every datum gained about .NET or quantum computing, I forget a digit of my phone number. That didn’t leave me without a few tough choices to make. I wound up sitting in on a pair of excellent talks on accessibility from Homer Gaines and Mark Noonan, both pretty exciting. They were the two talks that I circled first when I saw the schedule. A11y is definitely one of the topics I am trying to make room for now. After lunch, I saw Shawn Wildermuth’s convincing sales pitch on Tailwind CSS, and a slightly over-my-head talk on two-factor authentication by Todd Miranda, who is a real magician. Actually a real-life magician. Pretty cool. The final block of the day was a little harder to choose from. They all looked interesting but nothing jumped out at me. So I went with my gut and found a comfy chair near an outlet and watched the start of the Auburn - Georgia game. It did not go well for Auburn.<br />
<br />
All in all, it was a good day. I learned a few things, met a few people, and got to work on my Covid-sharpened discomfort with crowds of strange people. I’ll be going back next year and hopefully not wearing a mask. That doesn’t help with the strange people thing.</p>
